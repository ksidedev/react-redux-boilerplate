# React Redux Boilerplate

This helps get started with a react-redux project.

It also compiles SCSS to CSS

To get the sample up and running, you need to do the following:-
  - Clone the repo
  - Install the latest Node
  - Install NPM

```npm install```

To run the dev environment use:

```npm start```

and to create a static (prod) build use:
```npm run format```
```npm run build```

This project uses [Quick React Starter](https://github.com/jwarning/quick-react-starter.git) under the hood to manage all the build tooling.
